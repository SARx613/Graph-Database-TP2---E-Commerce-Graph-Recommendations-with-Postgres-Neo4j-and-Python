We can implement the startegy of the item-based similarity. It means that if a client buy a product that is very similar or complementary with an other then we would recommand the other too.
We can implement the PageRank algorithm to show on the website in first the more "popular" and personnalized products for the client.
For production I will add some protection to the databse since the password is password.
Also we could have more field for each product and customer like the age, the product category etc so we would have better recommandation.# Graph-Database-TP2---E-Commerce-Graph-Recommendations-with-Postgres-Neo4j-and-Python
